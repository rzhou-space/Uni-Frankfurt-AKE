There are two parts of functions. The first part of the functions is partial
functions that will be embedded in the final functions. Those are defined in
the second part.

The first part of the defined functions is:

1. read_expression_data(direction)
Read in expression data files .JSON generated by pipeline.

2. read_mov_data(direction)
Read in movement data files .JSON generated by pipeline.

3. PCA_tool(DataFrame, delete_column)
Applying PCA approach to get principal components and information content.

4. PCA_plot_mov(conditions, repl_num, info_content, plot_name, principalDf)
Visualization of PCA results from ewfd score calculated with movements.

5. PCA_plot_expression(conditions, replicates, info_content, plot_name, principalDf)
Visualization of PCA results from expression data.

The second part of the defined functions is:

1. repl_gene_expression(direction)
Generate a panel plot of gene expression data for all replicates based on PCA.

2. repl_transcript_expression(direction)
Generate a panel plot of transcript expression data for all replicates based on PCA.

3. repl_relative_transcript_expression(direction)
Based on PCA, generate a panel plot of relative transcript expression 
data for all replicates. Relative transcript expressions are calculated with 
transcript expressions. 

4. repl_ewfd(direction)
Based on PCA, generate a panel plot of the EWFD score for all replicates.
The EWFD scores are calculated based on movements and relative transcript expressions.
