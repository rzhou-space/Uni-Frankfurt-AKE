This model was thought to be used for only one cell type. And consider 
only active genes to visualize different analysis levels.

There are two parts of functions. The first part of the functions is partial
functions that will be embedded in the final functions. Those are defined in
the second part.

##############################################################################
The first part of the defined functions is:

1. read_expression_data(direction)
Read in expression data files .JSON generated by pipeline.

2. read_mov_data(direction)
Read in movement data files .JSON generated by pipeline.

3. active_genes(direction)
Sort out the list of active genes and also the gene expression DataFrame only 
containing them. 

4. PCA_tool(DataFrame, delete_column)
Applying PCA approach to get principal components and information content.

5. PCA_plot(conditions, info_content, plot_name, principalDf)
Visualization of PCA results for both mean expression DataFrames and mean
EWFD score DataFrame.

##############################################################################
The second part of the defined functions is:

1. active_gene_mean(direction)
Apply only active genes with PCA to represent mean values of gene expressions. 
A panel image of PCA results will be returned. 

2. active_transcript_mean(direction)
With the PCA representing mean values of transcript expressions only for 
active genes. 
A panel image of PCA results will be returned. 

3. active_rel_transcript_mean(direction)
With the PCA representing mean values of relative transcript expressions 
only for active genes. 
A panel image of PCA results will be returned. 

4. active_ewfd_mean(mov_direction, expr_direction)
With the PCA representing mean values of EWFD scores only for active genes. 
The EWFD scores are calculated with movements.
A panel image of PCA results will be returned.
