This model was thought to be used for only one cell type. And consider 
only active genes to visualize different analysis levels.

There are two parts of functions. The first part of the functions is partial
functions that will be embedded in the final functions. Those are defined in
the second part.

##########################################################################
The first part of the defined functions is:

1. read_expression_data(direction)
Read in expression data files .JSON generated by pipeline.

2. read_mov_data(direction)
Read in movement data files .JSON generated by pipeline.

3. active_genes(direction)
Sort out the list of active genes and also the gene expression DataFrame only 
containing them. 

4. PCA_tool(DataFrame, delete_column)
Applying PCA approach to get principal components and information content.

5. PCA_plot_expression(conditions, replicates, info_content, plot_name, principalDf)
Visualization of PCA results from expression data. 

6. PCA_plot_mov(conditions, repl_num, info_content, plot_name, principalDf)
Visualization of PCA results from ewfd score calculated with movements.

The second part of the defined functions is:

1. active_gene_expr(direction)
Apply only active genes with PCA to represent gene expressions. A panel image
of PCA results will be returned. 

2. active_transcript_expr(direction)
With the PCA representing transcript expressions only for active genes. 
A panel image of PCA results will be returned. 

3. active_relative_transcript_expr(direction)
With the PCA representing relative transcript expressions only for active genes. 
Relative transcript expressions are calculated from transcript expressions.
A panel image of PCA results will be returned. 

4. active_ewfd(mov_direction, expr_direction)
With the PCA representing EWFD scores only for active genes. 
The EWFD scores are calculated with movements.
A panel image of PCA results will be returned.
